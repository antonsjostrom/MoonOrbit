This project was done to see how effective it would be to use Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Pontryaginâ€™s Maximum Principle (PMP) to control a simulated spaceship around an orbit, in my case, a moon. The result is that it works well, and the process of going from the base case to more advanced planning and control was a fun step to explore.

My project paper is the best way to get started to understand the repo:
